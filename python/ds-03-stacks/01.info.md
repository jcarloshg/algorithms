# stacks

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) only from the top of the stack.
- Common stack operations: push (add), pop (remove), peek/top (view top element), isEmpty (check if stack is empty).
- Used in function call management, expression evaluation, undo mechanisms, and backtracking algorithms.
- Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
