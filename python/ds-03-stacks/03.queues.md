## Queues

- A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- Elements are added (enqueued) at the rear and removed (dequeued) from the front.
- Common queue operations: enqueue (add), dequeue (remove), front/peek (view front element), isEmpty (check if queue is empty).
- Used in scheduling, buffering, breadth-first search, and resource management.
- Can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or specialized structures like circular buffers.
