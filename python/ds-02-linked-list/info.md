# 🧩 Linked List Summary

> A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements (called **nodes**) are connected using pointers. Each node contains:
>
> - **Data**
> - **Reference** to the next node in the sequence

## 🚀 Key Features

- Efficient **insertion** and **deletion** of elements (especially compared to arrays)
- **Slower access by index** (requires traversal)

## 📚 Types of Linked Lists

| Type     | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Singly   | Each node points to the next node                |
| Doubly   | Each node points to both next and previous nodes |
| Circular | Last node points back to the first node          |
